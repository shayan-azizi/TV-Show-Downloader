# TV-Show-Downloader
I was a little lazy in downloading the series I wanted. So I made it automatic.

## How to use
- Download or clone the project
- Go to the project folder and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Then add your download path in config.json
- Type `python3 main.py` in command line and run the project
- Enjoy!
